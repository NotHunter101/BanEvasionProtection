# BanEvasionProtection

A simple plugin that uses "getipintel.net" to detirmine if a player joining the server is using VPN or proxy. This is incredibly useful because it will lower the amount of ban evaders by a considerable amount, because it disallows them from changing their IP. This plugin was barely tested before release, so use at your own risk. Of course, you could always use the source code and fix errors you find.
