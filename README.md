# BanEvasionProtection

A simple plugin that uses "getipintel.net" to detirmine if a player joining the server is using VPN or proxy. This is incredibly useful because it will lower the amount of ban evaders by a considerable amount, because it disallows them from changing their IP. This plugin was barely tested before release, so use at your own risk. Of course, you could always use the source code and fix errors you find.

# After testing, it seems this plugin will stop working is you use it too rapidly. This is because "getipintel.net" limits their requests. Also, there is an email hardcoded into the code. You will need to change it while building.
